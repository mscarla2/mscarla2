### Hey, welcome to my GitHub!
<p>
  My name is Marco Scarlata. I'm a generalist Software Engineer with a penchant for Machine Learning and Web Development. I graduated the University of Rochester in 2022 with a major in Computer Science and a double minor in Mathematics and Psychology. Currently, I'm a SWE @ Google and prior to that I've worked on numerous projects as an independent freelancer helping push out enterprise-level tools for my clients. At my core, my mission has always been to put our customers first, and engage with them collaboratively to make the best product. Beyond that, I have my own personal mission of delivering accessible software that unlocks our unlimited capacity for growth!

  On my free time, I love to swim and beatbox!
